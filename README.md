## About

This repository is a template for future hardware and software projects. My project documentation used to be barren, and suffered from a pervasive mentality of "as long as someone can _eventually_ figure out what I'm saying, then it's good enough." This is a framework to prevent that. You'll rarely want such a verbose README. Select portions relevant to your scope and audience then scrap the rest.

<img align="right" width="40%" src="https://i.imgur.com/8yo74NE.png" alt="image of apparatus or example results">

_for the description in the top-right, it's not always possible to explain all your project does. Just describe one main feature. One concrete example is more salient and easier to understand to a would-be user than an abstraction._

- _High level overview_
    - What was the motivation?
    - Why build this project?
    - What problem does it solve?
    - What are current approaches to this problem, their drawbacks, or why is this problem only solvable now?
    - How it works (e.g. data flow, state diagram)
    - Notable features
    - How it's organized:

## Installation
_assume whoever is reading is a novice, and may like more guidance with explicit instructions_

Hardware and software requirements like OS, chip architecture, circuits, components, sensors, controllers, effectors, and software licenses. Package manager and environment au du jour (e.g. `pip`, `homebrew`, software versions, package versions, Python `venv`, `virtualenv`).

<p align="left">
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/repository-template">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/repository-template.svg" alt="PyPi Package">
    </a>
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/repository-template">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/repository-template.svg" alt="Compatible Python Versions">
    </a>
</p>

For most users, who don't want to develop the repository-template code, installation should just be a matter of:
```console
pip install repository-template
```

The above option installs the latest released version. If you want access to the latest development version, the source code, example notebooks, and tests, you can install from source, by cloning and installing the GitHub repository:

1. Clone this repository:
```console
git clone https://github.com/mattrohr/repository-template.git && cd repository-template/
```

2. (_optional, but recommended_) Make and activate a virtual environment to reduce dependency conflict:
```console
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (```a```, ```b```, ```c```): 
```console
python3 install -r requirement.txt && brew install docker
```

4. Run the test suite:
```console
docker pull repository-template/standalone:1.6.3
docker run -t -i -e repository-template_OPTS='-Drepository-template.setup.test.all -Drepository-template.hostname=0.0.0.0 -Drepository-template.auth.disabled -Drepository-template.verbose' -p 3025:3025 -p 3110:3110 -p 3143:3143 -p 3465:3465 -p 3993:3993 -p 3995:3995 repository-template/standalone:1.6.3
```

## Usage
Options/flags, inputs, outputs:
| Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-f` | enforce name validation (e.g. first name, last name) | **(required)** |
| `-v` | Give verbose output | false |
| `-a` | Check all conditions | true |
| `ignore_timeout` | maximum allowed timeout before retry | (empty) |
| `tokens` | sign in credentials  | (empty) |
| `timeout` | request timeout | 120 |

## Example
_the quickest way for a developer to see a digestible result, like:_

Consider the following table, with a missing entry in an output column.

| Name | Birthdate | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Naomi P. King | 1973 | N. King '73 |
| Gorlov Tweedledie | 2000 | G. Tweedledie '00 |
| Allie D. Buttersworth | 2022 | ? |

Flash Fil infers intent and automatically fills in the missing entry with
"A. Buttersworth '22".

Perceptron Convergence Algorithm steps, variables, and parameters:
```
y(n) = actual response (quantized) d(n) = desired response
μ = learning-rate parameter, a positive constant less than unity
```

Fast Independent Component Analysis implementation:
```matlab
W = rand(2,1) ;
W = W/norm(W) ;
t1 = zeros(1,d1*d2) ;
t2 = zeros(2,d1*d2) ;
a = 1.1 ;

iteration = 5;
for i = 1:iteration
    i ;
    W_old = W ;
    t1 = tanh(a*W'*P) ;
    t4 = a./(cosh(a*W'*P).*cosh(a*W'*P)) ;
    t2(1,:) = P(1,:).*t1(1,:) ;
    t2(2,:) = P(2,:).*t1(1,:) ;
    t3 = (mean(t2'))' ;
    t5 = mean(t4).*W ;
    W  = t3 - t5 ;
    W  = W/norm(W) ;
    W_new = W ;
    converg(i) =  abs(W_new'*W_old) ;
    format long
    converg(i)
end

V = W'*P ;
Y = reshape(V,d1,d2);
subplot(2,3,3) ;
imshow(Y) ;
title('ICA Output') ;
imwrite(Y,'ICA-Output-1.png','png') ;
```

Run the Demo:
```console
python3 ./src/main.py
```

You'll end up with an image / result like this:

More sophisticated examples are located in [src/demo/](./src/demo/).

## Notes
- Project status
    - Active development? Is it stable? Do core features work?
    - Still more to do, and this project is looking for a maintainer
    - If development ceased, why? Is there a better alternative? Unforeseen and seemingly insurmountable problem? It's accomplished its goals?

- Design process and decisions, especially non-trivial ones
    - Our standard sort function performs a quick sort, but that does not preserve the order of items which we need here
    - The obvious algorithm would be ABC but that fails here because x could be negative so we need the generalized form (Wikipedia link)
    - Technology and technique selection and why (e.g. language choice)
    - Alternative technologies and techniques and why not
    - Nitty gritty of implementation
    - Redundant technology/method to validate primary technology/method
    - Explain what the tests test and why
    - Describe evolution of prototypes ([thorough mechanical example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag_p8gayrTs))
    - What you thought would work, but didn't, and why
    - Problems encountered and how you solved them
      - Whenever you run into a problem note it in the log
        - Checked out the code but it gave error XYZ0123, turns out I first had to upgrade component C to version 1.2 or higher
    - Performance metrics, design constraints, considerations like:
        - Safety:
            - security, privacy, consequences of failure modes, safety factor, consent
        - Performance:
            - accuracy, precision, speed, tolerance, response time, transfer rate, impact (e.g. what metrics do you have to support that you made the right decision)
        - Signal:
            - data (e.g. lossy/lossless format, compression, representative?, known bias), noise sources, [propagation of uncertainty](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Error-Analysis-Uncertainties-Measurements/dp/093570275X), error handling
        - Material:
            - material properties, temperature, toxicity, shelf life, weight/volume capacity
        - Operation:
            - system initialization (can be surprisingly tricky!), minimum number of operators, calibration, deployability, cross-platform compatibility, assembly/disassembly, installation/uninstallation, physical/electronic feedback (i.e. how easily can a user reason about its behavior when it's running), special handling, construction techniques, usability, reliability, repairability/maintainability (i.e. when things go wrong/preventative), adoptability (i.e. how transparent does the system, like machine learning algorithm, need to be in order to be adopted, what stakeholders need to sign off), accessibility, abilityability (how many -ability terms can you pad onto this considerations list before it gets weird?), location (e.g. presence of interfering ferrous material, change in ambient temperature and air pressure, magnetic field flux), planned lifetime, decay/consumables
        - Economics:
            - production: component sourcing, minimum order quantity, vendors, lead time, manufacturers, unit costs, gross margins, break even point,  total capital requirement
            - market: customer acquisition costs, lifetime value of customer, how fast is market growing? Finding previous three metrics matter _way_ more than total market size. Market research, especially what insight do you know about getting a customer that an outsider (e.g. investor, competitor) doesn't? How many competitors?

- Observations about the quality of the project
    - This code can use some refactoring
    - Did a quick implementation to get this to work but ABC would be better
    - How do real-world results compare to initial expectations/prototype/simulation/theory. What accounts for the difference?

- Limitations, caveats, issues that you would not want to formally record in an issue tracker
    - Should make this method work for `x < 0`, but that's currently out of scope

- To-do items / Roadmap / future directions
    - [x] ~~feature 1~~
    - [x] ~~performance optimizations~~
    - [x] ~~feature 2~~
    - [x] ~~rewrite~~
    - [x] ~~feature 3~~
    - [ ] feature 4
    - [ ] feature 5

- What did you learn?
    - Results? Show and tell.
    - Historical context 
    - If nothing was discovered, significant limits have been established for future projects
    - Amusing observations and stories of production

- Helpful links
    - Similar projects, even if they're not solving your same problem
    - Further reading
    - Links to alternative mediums describing this project (e.g. YouTube walkthrough, blogs, write-ups, podcasts, media interviews, journal/conference papers)
    - Links to real world examples (e.g. if project is a module or GitHub Action and not a standalone project)

- Contributing
    - Issues / pull requests / séance prayers to bug world are welcome
    - Good starter tasks and links to relevant issues/PRs
